# recordlivestream

This is used to record any Live stream comming from the internet. 

V1:
1.Find stream
2.Navigate to network in developer tools.
3.Take link address and copy into python shell. 
4. Run and its over.

Only thing the I added from original was to write date as the tittle of each mp4 so nothing gets overwritten.
